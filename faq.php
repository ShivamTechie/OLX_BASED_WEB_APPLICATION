                  <p>Classified Ads: Simple listings that include basic details about the product or service being offered. These are the most common type of ads and are usually organized by category.
                    <br>

                    Featured Ads: Ads that are given prominent placement on the site, such as at the top of search results or on the homepage, to increase visibility and attract more attention.

                    <br>
                    Banner Ads: Graphic or image-based ads that appear in various sections of the website, often used by businesses to promote their products or services.
                    <br>
                    Sponsored Ads: Paid advertisements that appear alongside organic listings, often labeled as "Sponsored" to distinguish them from regular ads.
                    <br>

                    Urgent Ads: Ads that are highlighted or marked as urgent, indicating that the seller needs to sell the item quickly. These ads often receive more attention from buyers looking for immediate deals.
                    <br>
                    Top Ads: Ads that are continuously shown at the top of category listings for a specific period, ensuring that they remain visible to users browsing that category.
                    <br>
                    Video Ads: Ads that include video content, allowing sellers to showcase their products or services in a more dynamic and engaging way. These are especially useful for complex products or services that benefit from a visual demonstration.

                    How Auctions Work?

                  <p>
                    Listing an Auction: Sellers create an auction listing by providing detailed information about the item they wish to sell. This includes a description, photos, starting bid, reserve price (if any), and auction duration.
                    <br>
                    Setting Up Bidding Parameters: Sellers set the starting bid amount and, optionally, a reserve price—the minimum amount they are willing to accept for the item. The auction duration determines how long the auction will be active.
                    <br>
                    Bidding Process: Buyers place bids on the auction item. Each bid must be higher than the previous one, and the current highest bid is visible to all participants. Bidders can place as many bids as they want within the auction period.
                    <br>

                    Auction Monitoring: Sellers and bidders can monitor the auction’s progress in real-time. Alerts or notifications may be provided for significant actions, such as receiving a new bid or nearing the auction's end.
                    <br>
                    Auction End: When the auction reaches its end time, the highest bid wins, provided it meets or exceeds the reserve price (if one was set). If the reserve price is not met, the item may not be sold.
                    <br>
                    Winning the Auction: The winning bidder receives a notification that they have won the auction. They are then required to complete the payment process as per the auction's terms.
                    <br>
                    Payment and Fulfillment: The seller and winning bidder arrange payment and delivery of the item. Payment methods and shipping arrangements are typically agreed upon after the auction ends.
                    <br>
                    Post-Auction: After the auction concludes, the seller ships the item to the winning bidder. Both parties may have the opportunity to leave feedback or a rating about the transaction, depending on the platform's features.

                    Review Cancellation Policy:


                    Check the seller's or platform’s cancellation policy to understand the terms and conditions regarding order changes or cancellations. Policies vary and may include specific timeframes and conditions.
                    <br>
                    Contact the Seller or Platform:

                    Reach out to the seller or customer service team as soon as possible. Most platforms provide a contact form, email address, or phone number for assistance with order issues.
                    <br>
                    Provide Order Details:

                    When contacting support, provide your order number, details of the item, and a clear explanation of your request to cancel or change the order. This helps expedite the process.
                    <br>
                    Request Cancellation or Change:

                    Specify whether you want to cancel the entire order or modify specific details (e.g., shipping address, quantity). If changing the order, provide the new information or options you prefer.
                    <br>
                    Confirmation and Follow-Up:

                    After submitting your request, confirm with the seller or support team that your cancellation or change has been processed. You may receive a confirmation email or notification.
                    <br>
                    Refunds and Adjustments:

                    If you cancel the order, inquire about the refund process and any applicable fees. For changes, ensure that any additional costs or adjustments are communicated clearly.
                    <br>
                    Act Quickly:

                    The sooner you request a cancellation or change, the higher the chances of successfully modifying your order. Orders in processing or shipped may have limited options for alteration.
